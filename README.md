### Description
With this Python script we're trying to solve the issue of automating the exporting and upload of pages to some kind of web hosting service.

### Pot Holes
* Selenium can't interact with native download windows

### Successes
* We did get Selenium automated all the way to the input window

### TODO:
* Try scraping my own web pages and formatting the HTML
* Try unofficial Python API perhaps?

### Hosting Options
* My github page (kjscott27.github.io) (_this would be ideal_)
* S3 bucket in AWS
